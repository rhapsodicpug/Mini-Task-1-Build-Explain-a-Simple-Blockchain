# Mini-Task-1-Build-Explain-a-Simple-Blockchain
Understand blockchain fundamentals, block structure, and consensus mechanisms by simulating a mini blockchain and explaining how it works â€” both technically and conceptually.


# React Blockchain Demo

A simple React app simulating a basic blockchain with mining and tampering features.

---

## Features

- Creates a blockchain with linked blocks having:
  - index, timestamp, data, previousHash, hash, and nonce
- Uses SHA-256 hashing (via `crypto-js`)
- Mines blocks with Proof-of-Work (difficulty = 4, hash starts with "0000")
- Displays nonce attempts and time taken during mining
- Allows adding new blocks with custom data
- Allows tampering with existing blocks to see how chain validity breaks
- Shows whether the blockchain is valid or invalid in real-time
